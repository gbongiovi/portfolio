### **[Sales Forecasting for a physical retailer]**
**16 out of 20 | Data Science for Business**

The objective was to forecast the sales for different stores of a retailer network. The project involved analyzing and preparing the data, developing a workflow to optimize model accuracy, and applying four different deep learning models and two ensemble trees for further comparison and analysis. On the project, the data used was from the actual retailer, however to preserve its confidentiality, the below code had used synthetic data and **not the data provided by the retailer**.

### **[Analyzing the Titanic survivals based on the sociodemographic characteristics]**
The primary goal of this analysis was using the Titanic dataset based on the real historical event of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. It was used to predict the survival of passengers based on various features, and getting insights of how the sociodemographic characteristics are related to the survival chances.

### **[Predicting occurrence of fires in the Brazilian Amazon based on seasonal data and climate phenomena]**
This project aims to analyze and predict the occurrence of fires in the Brazilian Amazon using various datasets, including historical fire data, and climate phenomena (El Niño and La Niña events). By building reliable predictive models, we aim to identify key factors influencing fire occurrences and provide insights for preventive measures.

## **2. Development Projects**
### **[Enterprise Resource Planning & Manufacturing Execution System]**
**18 out of 20 | Industrial Informatics**

With a colleague, two applications were created, an ERP and an MES, integrated into a database with the purpose of assisting a hypothetical company in its operational management, in the planning of production, purchase, sales, and shipping orders; and in the execution of these orders in the factory. The project involved a high degree of programming and integration of different platforms, in addition to the design of the user interfaces. PostgreSQL, Lazarus and Free Pascal were used for this purpose.

### **[Gym Management System Prototype]**
**17 out of 20 | Information Systems**

Along with four colleagues, we developed an application for managing a gym, involving 5 different types of users with unique accesses. The prototype has a high amount of functionality. The project was divided into two phases, initially, it involved project management and conceptual design of the system, and then it was created.

### **[BRASA Finance website]**
**16 out of 20 | Enterprise Information Systems**

Development of a web page integrated with the database without recourse to external sources in 15 days. The page allows the creation of different user types, CRUD management, information visualization, search filters, event registration, and others. As it was a short-term project, only 75% of the project was implemented. For it, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, PostgreSQL were used.
